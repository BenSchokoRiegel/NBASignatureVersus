### Introduction

**NBA Signature Battle** is a mobile app designed to elevate pick-up basketball games by integrating NBA Signature Moves into the gameplay. Players engage in 1vs1 matches, where the attacking player must attempt a specific NBA Signature Move shown in a short video clip on the app. The defender remains unaware of the move being attempted. This app brings the excitement of NBA moves to the real court, enhancing competitiveness and fun.

### App Description

Imagine a 1vs1 pick-up basketball game where the attacking player can only score using the NBA Signature Move displayed on the app. The app showcases short videos of these moves, adding a surprise element to the game. The defender is kept in the dark about the specific move being executed. If the attacking player successfully scores using the displayed move, they retain the ball and the phone. Otherwise, possession switches to the defender.

Key Features:
